# Variable Selection and Goodness-of-fit Testing in High-Dimensional Linear Models with Endogeneity

## Description 

The R package ['Variable_Selection_GoF_testing_under_endogeneity'](https://github.com/christiskatsouris/Variable_Selection_GoF_testing_under_endogeneity) implements the coding procedure for the resarch project titled: "Variable Selection and Goodness-of-fit Testing in High-Dimensional Linear Models with Endogeneity" which is joint work with [Dr Panayiota Touloupou](https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/staff/profiles/maths/touloupou-panayiota.aspx), School of Mathematics, University of Birmingham, United Kingdom. 

## Methodology

In this paper, wee propose a novel dimension reduction methodology which operates within a sequential variable selection framework. Specifically, a high dimensional vector of available covariates is scanned sequentially in order to identify the best correctly specified model and associated selected covariates, that is, the correct functional form. Furthermore, the statistical model under consideration tackles the aspect of endogeneity in high dimensional linear models. Our empirical application considers an important application for medical sciences.

#### Charles Stein

Charles Stein  (22 March 1920 – 24 November 2016) was an American mathematical statistician and professor of statistics at Stanford University. 
He received his Ph.D in 1947 at Columbia University with advisor Abraham Wald. He held faculty positions at Berkeley and the University of Chicago before moving permanently to Stanford in 1953. He is known for Stein's paradox in decision theory, which shows that ordinary least squares estimates can be uniformly improved when many parameters are estimated; for Stein's lemma, giving a formula for the covariance of one random variable with the value of a function of another when the two random variables are jointly normally distributed; and for Stein's method, a way of proving theorems such as the Central Limit Theorem that does not require the variables to be independent and identically distributed (Source: Wikepedia).
